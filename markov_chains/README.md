# Markov Chains

Markov Chains is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the
probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. We can 
represent it using a digraph, where the nodes represent states and edges represent transition probabilities.

## Assignment Problem

Consider the following problem

![markov-chain.png](https://thundering-leech-b51.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F8247a7b3-d50c-4aa5-963c-7519b7531c91%2FUntitled.png?id=094fe0da-35ec-4af8-9fa6-36dbec898b17&table=block&spaceId=0d778833-fd6e-4d85-89c3-c7db9e1bd3c7&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)

Write a code in Python to solve the above. I leave the exact details and the API to your imagination.
